# Gamification Toolkit Functionality Documentation

This document provides an overview of the functionality of the Gamification toolkit module, explaining its core capabilities and roles without delving into specific code implementations.

## Overview

The Gamification Toolkit is designed to facilitate the integration and management of gamification features within applications. It includes services and utilities that support the awarding of points, and managing of user achievements through a centralized service.

## Folder Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main source files of the toolkit.
  - **config.js**: Stores configuration settings like API credentials and endpoints.
  - **index.js**: Serves as the entry point for the module.
  - **services/**: Contains files related to service logic.
    - **PointsService.js**: Manages point allocation and queries related to point balances.
  - **utils/**: A place for utility functions that support the functionality of the services.
  
- **test/**: Contains unit tests for the toolkit functionalities.

## Core Components

### Gamification Class

- **Purpose**: Manages authentication and session management for the gamification features.
- **Functionality**:
  - Handles the retrieval and storage of an access token necessary for authenticated requests to a gamification server.
  - Ensures that all requests from this toolkit to the server are authenticated correctly and managed through environment variables.

### Points Service

- **Purpose**: To provide methods and operations that allow the manipulation and querying of point-related data for users.
- **Functionality**:
  - Adds points to a user's account based on actions defined in the client application.
  - Checks the point balance and updates the score in real-time or near real-time.
  - Maintains a log of all point transactions to ensure accurate accounting and auditing capabilities.(Later)

### Configuration Management

- **Purpose**: Holds all configuration necessary for the operation of the toolkit, including API keys, secrets, and endpoint URLs.
- **Functionality**:
  - Centralizes all configuration settings to ease maintenance and scalability of the toolkit.

### Utilities

- **Purpose**: Supports the main services with common functionality such as data formatting, validations, and other helper features.
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides a repository of reusable codes like formatting and validation, which are used across different parts of the toolkit.

## Testing Framework

- **Purpose**: Ensures the reliability and accuracy of the toolkit by running predefined tests against the implementation.
- **Functionality**:
  - Validates the correctness of the functionality provided by the toolkit through automated test cases.
